JGoff-HTML-Stringy

HTML::Stringy is meant to be a quick-and-dirty HTML parser, not much else. If
you need flexibility or robustness, please look into XML::LibXML or
HTML::TreeBuilder. In fact this module should be treated as a thin wrapper
around XML::LibXML. If you need XPath or DOM manipulation, this is not the
module to use.

Since it depends upon XML::LibXML it naturally requires that libxml2 be
installed on the host machine, along with XML::LibXML. It offers no more than
a quick way to grab a known <div/> or <h1/> out of an HTML document. If you
have more sophisticated needs, look to the underlying module.
